== Usage

=== Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

=== Build

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

=== Run

```bash
node dist/aoc-2024.js -d <day> -i <input file>
```

=== Test

```bash
npm test
```

NOTE: Only a few modules are covered by tests. That's more of a sanity check than proper coverage.

== List of puzzles

[%header,cols="70,~,~,~",format=csv]
|===
Day,Part I,Part II,Execution time
--SELFTEST-DATA--
|===

== Full-test mode

Create `.csv` file with a list of inputs/answers, formatted like that:

```csv
1,day-1.txt,420,69
2,day-2.txt,690,42
...
```

where columns are

1. Day number (number)
2. Input file location, *relative to `.csv` file location*
3. Answer for part 1 (number)
4. Answer for part 2 (number)

Then build project as described

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

And run full-test

```bash
node dist/aoc-2024.js -f <csv file location>
```
